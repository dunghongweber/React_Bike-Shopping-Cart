# Problems:

Users view and order bike(s) from a website. User can view details when click on a single bike/product.
Cart will store all the added bike(s) by user, it also has total price calculated for user. User can remove all bike(s) from cart or delete single bike/item in cart (or reduce its quantity).
Framer Motion is used to provide animation and better UI experience. Redux (Toolkit) is used to manage state and data efficiently in the web app.

# What I learned:

Installing and setting up react-redux and react toolkit.
Implememting redux with the help of redux toolkit to create reducer, store, slice.
Working with multiple state inside a redux slice.
Working with dispatch and selector to access and manage necessary state(s) in the app at/with different component.
Implementing different effects/animations of Framer Motion.
Using React states and Hooks to control data flow and styles in the app.
Working with colors and patterns to create cool atmosphere for the app.

# Reflex:

this project helps me to practice my skill with Materialize CSS, React Hooks, and Framer Motion.
I also learn how to work with redux and use redux toolkit to access and manage states at different components in the web app. This helps data flow smoother and easier to manage.
